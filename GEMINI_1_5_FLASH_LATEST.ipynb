It is recommended for the short-term treatment of mild to moderate \\npain such as headache, toothache, muscle and joint pain and menstrual pain.  \\nIt also relieves fever associated with common colds and flu. \\n \\nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 3 days of fever and 5 days \\nof pain or if other symptoms appear.  \\n \\nParacetamol is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older. \\n \\n2.

Higher doses than \\nrecommended will not lead to better pain relief, instead it increases the risk of very severe liver damage. \\nThe symptoms of liver damage usually appear after a few days.

You should use the lowest possible dose that \\nreduces your pain and/or your fever and use it for the shortest time possible.
